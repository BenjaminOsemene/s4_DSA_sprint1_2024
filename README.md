This Java program implements a simple To-Do List manager where users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view their list of tasks. Each user has it's own to-do list, which is represented as a single linked list of tasks. Users are stored in an array.

The key features of this project include:
- Create users and store them in an array
- Add tasks to a user's to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed
- View all tasks in a user's to-do list

The program structure include:
- "Task.java": A single task with description and completion status
- "TaskList.java": Uses a single linked list to store tasks
- "User.java": Shows a user with a name and a to-do list
- "Main.java": Contains the main method to demonstrate the functionality

To run the program, compile all java files by running the command
javac *.java then run the Main class using the command java Main.
